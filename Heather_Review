Hi, Grace!
     Your script ran without any problems. Excellent work! Here are a couple of suggestions:
     
     1. I'm debating whether to keep my "view" commands in as they are really just for me to double check, but slows down the code for a viewer. 
     How do you feel about keeping them in v. removing them?
     
     2. It may be more descriptive to change the y-axis labels on your visuals to something like "Distribution" using command ylab("Distribution")
     
     3. For the zygosity visual, I did both species and groups. That is how I understood the assignment prompt, but perhaps double check?
     If that is the case, you will need an additional visual for the last assignment prompt. 
     
     Overall, I am impressed by how smoothly the script ran and how well written it is. I can tell you worked really hard on this!
     
     Best,
     Heather
